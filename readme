This is completly based on deep learning nueral network and implented using Tensorflow framework. Here you will get how to implement fastly and you can find code at github and uses is demonstrated at YouTube.

Installation Python Libraries:
Tensorflow (1.4.0)
Scipy (0.17.0)
Scikit-learn (0.19.1)
Opencv (2.4.9.1)

first run inilizer.py (it will align all images and generate coordinate for images 
then run classifier.py
run test_video.py file to recognize actors from video file
